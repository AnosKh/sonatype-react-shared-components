# How to be a contributor to this project

## Talk to a human first

Looking to dive in? FANTASTIC! Reach out to one of our experts and we can help. Hit us up on our Slack channel #react-components.

## For Non-Sonatypers

* Come hang out with us at our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers).
* Fill out a CLA for us, so we can sort out all the legal parts of contributing. You can get all the information for
this [here](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-ContributingBundles). You may go, this is for your book, is it
applicable for this repo? Yes, absolutely. Follow the CLA process and email in your form. We are working on a way to
make this simpler, as well.

## Are you submitting a pull request?

* Use [our codestyle](https://github.com/sonatype/codestyle). If we get a PR that doesn't match it, there will be
much shaming throughout the land. If you use an editor besides Eclipse or IntelliJ, adapt the codestyle and submit a PR
there :)
* Add the @sonatype/shared-components-group as a reviewer to the PR
* Make sure to fill out an issue (Jira RSC project) for your PR, so that we have traceability as to what you are trying to fix,
versus how you fixed it.
* Try to fix one thing per pull request! Many people work on this code, so the more focused your changes are, the less
of a headache other people will have when they merge their work in.
* Ensure your Pull Request passes tests either locally or via TravisCI (it will run automatically on your PR)
* If you're stuck, ask our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers)! There are a number of
experienced programmers who are happy to help with learning and troubleshooting.
